     * `canManage && access !== null` fell to false, and the owner got a
     * modal that was silently read-only with nothing on screen saying why —
     * indistinguishable from genuinely not being allowed to manage it.
     * Rejecting here instead routes the failure into the modal's own error
     * line (userFacingApiError, so a 4xx shows the server's wording).
