-- Migration date: 2026-09-16
-- Record, on the upload file row, the moment the worker wrote the destination
-- documents row for a `document_create` upload.
--
-- Why: a retried upload must not resurrect a document the user deleted while
-- the first attempt was running, but it also must not give up when the first
-- attempt failed BEFORE the row existed (a storage read error, a transient
-- database error on the upsert itself). Nothing durable distinguished those
-- two "row is missing on retry" cases; the attempt counter cannot. This
-- column can: it is set only after the upsert succeeded, so on a retry
--   marker set   + row missing  => the row was deleted, stop for good;
--   marker unset + row missing  => the row was never written, create it.
-- Existing rows stay null, which reads as "never written" and lets any
-- in-flight retry proceed exactly as it did before this migration.
alter table public.upload_session_files
  add column if not exists document_created_at timestamptz;

-- The backend refuses to serve when the lifecycle contract it depends on is
-- not installed (lib/dbq/lifecycleGuard.ts). The marker column is part of
-- that contract from this migration on: the worker stamps it after every
-- documents upsert and treats a failed stamp as a failed upload, so code
-- deployed ahead of this file would fail every new-document upload while the
-- version-1 probe still reported the database healthy. Version 2 = the five
-- lifecycle RPCs AND the column.
