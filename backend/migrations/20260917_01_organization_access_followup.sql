-- Migration date: 2026-09-17
--
-- Forward corrections to 20260904_01_organization_access.sql and
-- 20260904_02_migrate_legacy_sharing.sql. Both of those files are merged and
-- have already run on upgraded deployments, so they are not edited; every
-- fix that was drafted against them is re-expressed here so that a fresh
-- install (schema.sql) and an upgraded deployment end at the same shape.
--
-- Sequence _02 is used deliberately: 20260912_01 is claimed by the scoped
-- memory follow-up branch that has not landed yet.
--
-- Safe to re-run: every statement is guarded or idempotent.

-- 1. workflow_access_role(): compare recipient emails case-insensitively.
--
-- get_workflows_overview lists a share with lower() on both sides, while this
-- function compared the stored value raw against lower(p_user_email). A
-- legacy mixed-case row was therefore LISTED for its recipient and then 404'd
-- the moment they opened it, and re-sharing produced a second row instead of
-- updating the first. Section 4 below normalises the stored values and adds a
-- lowercase CHECK; this stays symmetrical with the overview regardless.

-- upgraded deployment ends up with a weaker posture than a fresh one for
-- precisely the tables that decide who can see a firm's matters. Revoking a
-- privilege that is not held is a no-op.

-- 3. Repair what the 20260904_02 backfill wrote.
--
-- 3a. A legacy shared_with array could contain the creator's own address
--     (their own invitation, echoed back). The backfill turned that into an
--     EDITOR grant on the creator's own project or review: the project reads
--     as "Shared with 1 user" and the owner appears as a guest on their own
--     matter, a state the API itself refuses to create. Remove those rows.
--     auth.users is the authoritative address; user_profiles can be missing.
-- 3b. The backfill accepted any value with an '@' anywhere, including
--     '@x.com' (no local part). Remove rows that are not addresses.

-- 3c. Archive for direct shares on project-contained reviews.
--
-- A contained review inherits access from its project, and
-- validate_direct_access_scope refuses a review-level grant on one, so the
-- new model has no row shape for "this person may see this review and
-- nothing else in the matter". 20260904_02 dropped tabular_reviews.shared_with
-- without recording those recipients. The table below is where they belong.
--
-- On a deployment that has already run 20260904_02 the column is gone and the
-- guarded backfill is a no-op: those recipients cannot be recovered from the
-- live database, only from a pre-upgrade backup (restore shared_with into a
-- scratch column and re-run this file). The table is still created so that
-- fresh and upgraded deployments share one schema and an operator has a
-- place to record what they re-grant.
--
-- No foreign key, deliberately: this is a historical record of who lost
-- access at upgrade and it has to outlive the rows it describes.
