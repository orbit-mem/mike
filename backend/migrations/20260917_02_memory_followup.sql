-- Migration date: 2026-09-17
--
-- Memory follow-ups for existing deployments that already ran
-- 20260905_01_scoped_memory_files and 20260909_01_memory_safety_boundaries
-- (both shipped with #451 and are therefore immutable). Fresh installs get
-- the same shape from schema.sql. Every statement is safe to re-run.
--
-- 1. memory_source_allows_app_memory(surface, conversation, actor, project)
--    replaces the (surface, project) form so a standalone chat that is
--    shared with a colleague cannot learn into the owner's private app
--    memory; memory_project_is_private carries the project test.
-- 2. delete_user_private_memories row-locks the caller's own private
--    projects instead of taking SHARE locks on projects and
--    project_access_grants from a user-facing DELETE.
-- 3. schedule_memory_consolidation locks memory files through the unique
--    indexes (array + union) instead of a table scan per assistant turn,
--    reaps leases after a day, waits one quiet window after crash recovery,
--    and no longer continues as a silent no-op without its state row.
-- 4. write_memory_file owns the unchanged-body decision (applied=false with
--    the job receipt still stamped); conflicts raise P0001 rather than
--    40001, which PostgREST never answers.
-- 5. lock_memory_conversation_source's tabular branch verifies the chat
--    owner (it overwrote its own comparison variable).
-- 6. All SECURITY DEFINER memory functions set search_path = public, pg_temp.
-- 7. Indexes: memory_consolidation_results(memory_file_id) and (created_at),
--    partial db_jobs probes for the memory epoch checks, the
--    user-referencing columns account deletion walks, and the redundant
--    chat_messages(chat_id) prefix index is dropped.

-- (chat_id) is a strict prefix of the index above; keeping both taxes every
-- chat message insert for nothing.
